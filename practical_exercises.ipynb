    "These exercises are to help you work through some of the concepts from the lecture, to get a practical idea of how to use machine learning to help in biomarker discovery.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This is by no means a comprehensive notebook! It's intended to give you a flavour of some of the tools that are out there for this problem. Ultimately, biomarker discovery is a research area in its own right, and machine learning takes much longer than a couple of hours to learn!  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main goals for this practical exercise are:\n",
    "* to understand how Jupyter notebooks can be used as a Python development environment\n",
    "* to appreciate how to use documentation and LLMs to aid you in writing code\n",
    "* to learn how to use Pandas to read in and manipulate a dataset\n",
    "* to perform exploratory data analysis using Pandas on a dataset\n",
    "* to use UMAP for dimensionsality reduction and visualisation\n",
    "* to understand how to build a ML-based classifier for biomarkers\n",
    "* to use clustering on a dataset \n",

    "* Ask for help from your peers and your instructors\n",
    "* You can use ChatGPT/other AI for help, and it will be very good at it, but **try to write the code yourself first**. This is a learning exercise, it is not assessed, and you will learn better if you try to solve the problem yourself first\n"

If `n_neighbors` is large, you're asking UMAP to make each data point look like a lot of others, so it tends to find larger clusters but remove fine-scale features. If `n_neighbors` is small, you might get fine-scale features but the UMAP plot might look very spiky and not smooth\n",

    "* The RandomForest that you've used to predict DESNT has hyperparameters, as we discussed earlier. How does the ROC curve and area under it change if you change these parameters? How high can you make the area under the curve by just changing these?\n",
    "* A random forest isn't the only model you could use for prediction! How does it compare to: `sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier` or `sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`. Which model performs the best in this problem?\n",

    "* `Kaggle`: https://www.kaggle.com/ is a free resource with datasets, online notebooks and tutorials all showing how to use machine learning to solve various problems. It's also increasingly important in the industry to use Kaggle to build a portfolio\n",
    "* `Google Machine Learning Crash Course`: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course is a free course which teaches the basics of machine learning\n",
    "* There are generally loads of papers, at all levels of difficulty, explaining machine learning topics. However, this paper is specifically aimed for people coming from a more biological background and is extremely well written: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41580-021-00407-0 "
