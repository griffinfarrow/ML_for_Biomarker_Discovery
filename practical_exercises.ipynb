    "These exercises are to help you work through some of the concepts from the lecture, to get a practical idea of how to use machine learning to help in biomarker discovery.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This is by no means a comprehensive notebook! It's intended to give you a flavour of some of the tools that are out there for this problem. Ultimately, biomarker discovery is a research area in its own right, and machine learning takes much longer than a couple of hours to learn!  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main goals for this practical exercise are:\n",
    "* to understand how Jupyter notebooks can be used as a Python development environment\n",
    "* to appreciate how to use documentation and LLMs to aid you in writing code\n",
    "* to learn how to use Pandas to read in and manipulate a dataset\n",
    "* to perform exploratory data analysis using Pandas on a dataset\n",
    "* to use UMAP for dimensionsality reduction and visualisation\n",
    "* to understand how to build a ML-based classifier for biomarkers\n",
    "* to use clustering on a dataset \n",

    "* More of your time coding is spent fixing problems (\"debugging\") than it is writing new things\n",
    "* Ask for help from your peers and your instructors\n",
    "* You can use ChatGPT/other AI for help, and it will be very good at it, but **try to write the code yourself first**. This is a learning exercise, it is not assessed, and you will learn better if you try to solve the problem yourself first\n"

    "When developing a complicated program, which is sometimes called a library, you use these scripts to break up your workflow into several little pieces. This separates concerns: it means you can test each file separately and ensure that errors are easy to track down. This is the workflow that is absolutely used in practice.  \n",

We're going to use them exclusively.  \n",
